## Type in TypeScript

The type system in TypeScript describes the various data types supported by the language. It is divided into three main categories: any type, built-in types, and user-defined types. The type system in TypeScript is responsible for ensuring that data types are correct before they are used in a program.

- **Does not support multiple merged declarations.**
- **Does not have implementation purposes.**
- **More flexible.**
- **Does not inherently support the use of an object.**
  

##  Interface in TypeScript

An interface in TypeScript is a syntactic contract that entities must adhere to. It can contain only declarations of properties, methods, and events, without any implementation. Interfaces define a standard structure that implementing classes must follow.

- **Supports multiple merged declarations.**
- **Used for implementation and extending in classes.**
- **Less flexible compared to type.**
- **Supports the use of an object.**
